# Build iwasm
WAMR supports building the iwasm VM core only (no app framework) to the mini product. The WAMR mini product takes the WASM application file name or AOT file name as input and then executes it. For the detailed procedure, please see **[build WAMR VM core](./doc/build_wamr.md)** and **[build and run WASM application](./doc/build_wasm_app.md)**. Also we can click the link of each platform above to see how to build iwasm on it.
