# Welcome

Welcome to home page of WAMR documentation, WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is a open source project under [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/). As the name suggests, it is a lightweight standalone WebAssembly (WASM) runtime with small footprint, high performance and highly configurable features for applications cross from embedded, IoT, edge to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), smart contract, cloud native and so on.

## How to navigate the documentation

If you are a complete beginner who just step in the world of WebAssembly or just looking for killing some time and learn something fun, start with [appendix A. background knowledge 101](appendix/background-knowledge.md) and our [introduction chapter](basics/introduction/README.md). Also, you could learn how to run a hello world server-side wasm application using runtime WAMR in [getting started chapter](basics/getting_started/README.md).

If you are familiar with WebAssembly in some extent and want to explore what WAMR can do for you as a user and developer.You could first check out [tutorial on how to use WAMR](tutorial/README.md), including how to [build different running mode](tutorial/build_tutorial/README.md), how to [embed WAMR into your application](tutorial/language_embedding/README.md) and how to [debug with WAMR](tutorial/debugging%26IDE_support/README.md). Then you could visit complete list of [features](features/demo_examples/README.md) WAMR supported to see whether certain feature interest you and would serve your demands well. If at the end of day, you start to optimize and take performance into consideration or want to utilize advanced feature, including **application framework** and **dynamic management**. You could find them in [advance tutorial chapter](advance_tutorial/README.md).

And of course, you can always utilize search function on top right corner to locate whichever topic triggers your interest.
