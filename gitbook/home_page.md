# Welcome

Welcome to home page of WAMR documentation, WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is a open source project under [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/). As the name suggests, it is a lightweight standalone WebAssembly (WASM) runtime with small footprint, high performance and highly configurable features for applications cross from embedded, IoT, edge to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), smart contract, cloud native and so on.

## How to navigate the documentation

If you are a complete beginner who just step in the world of WebAssembly or just looking for killing some time and learn something fun, start with [background knowledge 101](appendix/background-knowledge.md) and our [introduction section](basics/introduction/README.md). And you could run a hello world server-side wasm application using runtime WAMR follow [this tutorial](basics/getting_started/README.md).

If you are familiar with WebAssembly in some extent and want to explore what WAMR can do for developers. You could first check out [how to use WAMR](tutorial/README.md), including how to [build different running mode](tutorial/build_tutorial/README.md), how to [embed WAMR into your application](tutorial/language_embedding/README.md) and how to [debug with WAMR](tutorial/debugging%26IDE_support/README.md). You could even test the performance and do fine-tuning based on your need follow this [tutorial](tutorial/performance%26footprint/README.md). Then you could visit complete list of [features](features/README.md) WAMR supported to see whether certain feature would serve your demands well.

And of course, you can always utilize search function on top right corner to locate whichever topic triggers your interest.
