# Getting started: a hello world program

In this section, you'll learn how to run a simple hello world wasm program either on your host or on Docker environment. The tutorial on docker is the recommend way for you don't need to worry about all the platform-related dependencies and compatibility problem. The hello world program is to give you a taste of what our WAMR could do as server-side runtime and ready you for more detail guide at the end of this chapter. The [latter guide](../../../doc/build_wasm_app.md) cover the meaning of the compile and build option in detail and give suggestions on how to fine-tune your wasm module.More example programs in [section 4. Examples](../../features/demo_examples/README.md)

Now, last piece of gibberish before you get your hand dirty:
