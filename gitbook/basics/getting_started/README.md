# Getting started: a hello world program

In this section, you'll learn how to run a simple hello world wasm program on your host or the Docker environment using WAMR. The docker tutorial is recommended so you don't have to worry about all the platform-related dependencies and compatibility problems. The hello world program will give you a taste of what our WAMR could do as server-side runtime and ready you for a more detailed guide at the end of this chapter. The [latter guide](../../../doc/build_wasm_app.md) covers the meaning of the compile and build option in detail and gives suggestions on fine-tuning your wasm module. More example programs can be found in [section 4. Examples](../../features/demo_examples/README.md)

Now, here is the last piece of gibberish before you get your hand dirty:

Clone our source code repo and use
