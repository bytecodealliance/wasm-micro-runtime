# Introduction

In this section, we will introduce you some basic knowledge about [WebAssembly](./webassembly.md) and our project [WAMR](./wamr-project.md).

We understand because of our background vary, some terms in the following section may sound familiar but vague. We have a primer [Appendix B](../../appendix/background-knowledge.md) gathering some details about background knowledge(compiler, interpreter, runtime system, all other jargons) that maybe helpful and free you from googling around. You are more than welcome to check it out.
