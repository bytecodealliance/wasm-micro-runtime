# Introduction

In this chapter, we will introduce you to some basic knowledge about [WebAssembly](./webassembly.md) and our project [WAMR](./wamr_project.md). And discuss the security feature that Webassembly language itself and WAMR's enhancement can bring in [this section](./security_feature.md)

We understand because our backgrounds vary, some terms in the following section may sound familiar but vague. We have a primer in [Appendix A](../../appendix/background_knowledge.md) gathering some details about background knowledge(compiler, interpreter, runtime system, all other jargon) that may be helpful and free you from googling around. You are more than welcome to check it out.
