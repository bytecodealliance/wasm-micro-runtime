# language embedding

As we mentioned before, WAMR is not only a server-side runtime for a wasm application but also a library that you could embed in your application. What's even better is that we support several programming languages so that you can choose your favorite language to embed WAMR to run the wasm app.

The language WAMR support embedding:

- [C/C++](../../../doc/embed_wamr.md)
- [Python](../../../language-bindings/python/README.md)
- [Go](../../../language-bindings/go/README.md)
