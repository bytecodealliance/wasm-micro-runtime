# Tutorial

In this chapter, we want to walk you through the basic development knowledge and skills of WARM you may need so that you are ready to write your wasm application with WARM.

For starters, you could learn how to compile different running mode of WAMR and their usage in [this section](build-tutorial/README.md).

Then, as we said before, WAMR is not limited to being a command line application that runs wasm code. You could also [embed WAMR](language-embedding/README.md) into your application.

And don't forget the one important stage of developing, namely debugging. We cover it in [this section](debugging%26IDE-support/README.md).
