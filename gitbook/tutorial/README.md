# Tutorial

In this chapter, we want to walk you through the basic development knowledge and skills of WARM you may need so that you are ready for writing your wasm application with WARM.

For starter, you could learn how to compile different running mode of WAMR and their usage in [this section](build_tutorial/README.md).

Then, like we said before, WAMR is not limited to being a command line application run wasm code. You could also [embed WAMR](language_embedding/README.md) into your application.

And don't forget the one important stage of developing, namely debug, we cover it in [this section](debugging&IDE_support/README.md).
