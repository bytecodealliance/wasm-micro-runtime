Welcome to the chapter of advance tutorial.

If you care about performance(don't we all?), want to know what's WAMR stand among other wasm runtime or want to fine tune memory footprint of your wasm application. You could refer to [this section](performance%26footprint/README.md)

In later sections, you could find tutorial on how to use [application framework](../../doc/wamr_api.md) and [dynamic management](remote_applicatoin_management/README.md)
