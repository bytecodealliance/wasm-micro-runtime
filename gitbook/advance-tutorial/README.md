# Advance tutorial

Welcome to the chapter of the advanced tutorial.

If you care about performance(don't we all?), want to know whether WAMR stands out among other wasm runtimes with respect to your demands, or wish to fine-tune your wasm application's memory footprint. You could refer to [this section](performance-benchmark/README.md)

In later sections, you can find the tutorial on how to use [application framework](../../doc/wamr_api.md) and [dynamic management](remote-applicatoin-management/README.md). Also, there is a tutorial on [how to port WAMR to the platform](../../doc/port_wamr.md)
