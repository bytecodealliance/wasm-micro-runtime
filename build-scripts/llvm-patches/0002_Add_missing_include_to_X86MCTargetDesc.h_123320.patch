Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Add missing include to X86MCTargetDesc.h (#123320)

In gcc-15, explicit includes of `<cstdint>` are required when fixed-size
integers are used. In this file, this include only happened as a side
effect of including SmallVector.h

Although llvm compiles fine, the root-project would benefit from
explicitly including it here, so we can backport the patch.

Maybe interesting for @hahnjo and @vgvassilev
